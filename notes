To Do:
* Build API call
* Build sounds
* Build default settings for audio generation
  * So that it works by default without user input off the bat
* Build interface for input data to modify audio generation
  * Determine what kind of user input data we want to use
    * canvas mouse pointer?
    * manually operated sliders as DOM objects in html?
    * hit another API for data input to affect sound generation
      * Google Maps
      *
